# IOT Mailbox Notifier
Mail Notifier prototype provides an example of how IOT technology can be used to create a
solution to a modern problem (in this case caused by a pandemic) as well as how these
technologies can be integrated with existing technology such as smartphones. It also shows how
older less technologically advanced systems and appliances such as a simple mailbox can be
upgraded or more modernized using low-cost platforms.

## 1 Project Scope
### 1.1 Problem statement
With the surge of people staying at home due to the pandemic, more and more people have been
at home receiving letters and parcels through their receiving mailbox since the amount of people
ordering items has spiked globally.
The proposed solution to this problem is an IOT device that will detect any form of parcel or mail
that is posted through the users mailbox and once detected will notify the user on their device or
platform of choice once it happens.
The device will be WIFI capable in order to communicate with the user and will be able to update
them from anywhere as long as they have a connection
